Bio-ORACLE v3 is a global marine environmental dataset developed for ecological and species distribution modeling. It provides a wide range of surface and benthic variables at 5.5 km x 5.5 km per pixel at the equator. The dataset includes temperature, salinity, chlorophyll-a, pH, dissolved oxygen, current velocity, and more. Data are available for multiple time periods, including historical (2000–2014), present, and future climate projections (SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5).

In the report, these layers from the period 2000–2100 are used. The datasets are too big to be included on the GitHub page, so the data will only be referred to.
